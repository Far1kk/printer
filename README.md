# printer
This project will be useful who want to implement a system for printing files remotely,
becouse there is little information on the vast Russian- and English-language sites in the field of this type of printing.
You can view implementation examples in my project.
For the work, you must connect a printer-server VPN connection.
In the hardware of the system, I used a router to create a local network and a modem to access the Internet anywhere.
The printer must support network protocols. The router must have a print server. On the server side there is a VPN server.
